A readme file. o.O

Prereqs:
XNA 4.0 or greater installed.
reference to mysql.data and system.data necessary.


Clone this repo and the content repo to the same parent directory.
Your file structure should look like this:

(parentDir)/sadc-gamejam-test
(parentDir)/sadc-gamejam-content

After doing so, you should be able to open your project out of the box.
Make sure not to commit any debug/generated files!

Added dependency on Mysql Connector. Not sure if it will cause any issues with
compile/run but if it does, just remove the reference to MySqlData or install mysql connector
